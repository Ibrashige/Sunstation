# Sunstation

This repository contains all the updated PCB schematics, MCU codes, & research information required to recreate the Sunstation electronics. Written by Lo√Øc Darboux with guidance from Chris Falconi and Ibrahim Qasim.

## Prerequisites

The following libraries must be installed on your computer for the main code to compile:
- <a href="https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_NeoPixel"> Adafruit_Neopixel </a>
- <a href="https://github.com/bblanchon/ArduinoJson"> ArduinoJson </a>
- <a href="https://github.com/contrem/arduino-timer"> arduino-timer </a>

*You must add the Arduino Nano board to your IDE. The instructions for doing so on the Arduino IDE can be found [here](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Guide/ArduinoNano).*

## Installation

Simply flash ```SunStationFirmware.ino``` to the Arduino Nano using the Arduino IDE or your editor of preference.

## Usage 

1. Place the Sunstation on a south-facing window with plenty of sunlight.
2. Push the tactile push button on the side to show battery LED display and toggle BLE bluetooth on.
3. Connect iOS or Android device to the Sunstation by downloading the Sunstation app, turning bluetooth on, and clicking the magnifying glass to search for Sunstation and show performance metrics.
4. Connect iOS device to either charging port and place it on detachable platform.

*+Ve Output/Bat+ and -Ve Output/Bat- lines are shared between the battery, comparator, current sensor module, boost converter module, and battery charging module.*

### Jauch LP90609JH LiPo Battery (To designated PCB terminals)
``` 
+Ve Wire (RED) -> Bat+
-Ve Wire (BLACK)-> Bat-
```
### TI TPS3700 Comparator (To boost converter)
```
VDD  -> VBAT
INA+ -> Voltage divider out (R1 = 154Kohm, R2 = 21.3Kohm)
OUTA -> EN
GND  -> PGND
```
*VBAT = +Ve Output of BQ24650.*
